# Healthcare Scan Risk Prioritizer

## Overview
In healthcare settings, doctors often face large volumes of patient scans and reports. Identifying which cases require immediate attention is critical for saving lives.  
This project provides a system that automatically classifies each scan into **High Risk, Medium Risk, or Low Risk**, ensuring that emergency cases are prioritized for faster treatment.
